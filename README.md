Selects default stylesheet for people using screen readers.

## Wait, what?
Screen readers don't always use the stylesheets designed for screen readers. That makes it difficult for blind people (who frequently rely on screen readers) to use the internet.

## Wow, that's super uncool of them
I know, right? Hopefully this helps people who *have* to use screen readers to surf the web.

**TL;DR:** This makes the web easier to use for people who are blind or have low vision.

Batou is the name of a character from *Ghost in the Shell*, who uses bionic eyes to see.
